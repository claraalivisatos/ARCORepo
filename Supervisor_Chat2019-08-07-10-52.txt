 [10:52:13 AM] 
 [11:02:11 AM] Instructor: pump delayed by 60 sec
 [11:02:28 AM] Reactor: 60 sec delay between pump frequency set and change in primary flow
 [11:06:15 AM] Instructor: operator actions not recording :(
 [11:14:06 AM] Instructor: got operator actions to work. looked at MATLAB script and "added to path" because something got messed up but it works now
 [11:19:28 AM] Supervisor: Res Gens are doing something
 [11:21:15 AM] Supervisor: Heater Control Res responded to something
 [11:22:02 AM] Instructor: after fault we lost control of the pump?
 [11:22:47 AM] Supervisor: Eddie needs to figure out what controls the residual generator interface
 [11:22:48 AM] Reactor: flow rate dropping rapidly
 [11:22:55 AM] Reactor: no more control of the heater power
 [11:24:02 AM] Instructor: pump VFD is now set back to set value so we regained control of the pump?
 [11:25:01 AM] Reactor: regained control of the pump
 [11:25:44 AM] Instructor: when we did spoof, nothing changed on reactor operator VI
 [11:26:15 AM] Instructor: tried spoof again, nothing happened with reactor operator (so far)
 [11:26:51 AM] Reactor: flow rate dropping
 [11:27:58 AM] Instructor: reactor operator VI very delayed because got spoof 1 min after instructor pressed spoof, also keep losing control of pump (VFD goes to 0) 
 [11:28:12 AM] Instructor: but we regain control of the pump
 [11:28:25 AM] Supervisor: First fault ended
 [11:30:49 AM] Instructor: Need to put in operator action recorder function for CTAH
 [11:30:49 AM] Supervisor: CTAH Heate Removal res activity was due to CTAH setpoint changing
 [11:34:03 AM] Supervisor: Blocking CTAH
 [11:34:04 AM] Reactor: CTAH fan obstructed. CTAH temperature rising
 [11:34:48 AM] Reactor: temperatures dropped back to steady 80.4
 [11:34:57 AM] Reactor: temperatures now rising 
 [11:35:50 AM] Reactor: temperatures falling back to 80
 [11:36:06 AM] Supervisor: End spoof 2
 [11:36:50 AM] Reactor: temperatures changed by 10 degrees, reaching around 89
 [11:36:57 AM] Supervisor: Not a major fluctuation due to fan blockage in res gens
 [11:38:35 AM] Reactor: increased CTAH set point to keep temperatures above 80
 [11:38:55 AM] Supervisor: Hot Leg Blockage Spoof
 [11:39:33 AM] Reactor: CTAH temperature 76.7
 [11:41:00 AM] Reactor: temperature now dropping to 75.9
 [11:41:13 AM] Supervisor: No major residual activity due to hot leg blockage
 [11:41:43 AM] Supervisor: End hot leg fault
 [11:52:17 AM] Reactor has aborted communication.
 [11:52:36 AM] Instructor has aborted communication.
